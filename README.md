How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

By creating a set of user stories, this helps a software development team implement functionalities that meet these needs. The user stories do not suggest a means for accomplishing these goals, rather, they just state the goal and reason why they would like this functionality. The team can then use their creative efforts to realize these. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

In my future development work, I will try to break my project into shorter iterations, each which produces a working piece of code, even if it's simple or reduced in functionality from the finished product. This will give me the opportunity to test my code along the way instead of waiting until the end. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development, one must be accountable for their work. The Scrum/agile methodolgies count on members of the team to be self-motivated and take responsibility for their contributions to the project. After this, skills in communication are vital for being a valuable asset to the team. It's important for each member of the team to be open and transparent about their process, even if it's a setback or shortcomings. Instead of getting stumped and letting work becoming stagnant, asking for help early can benefit the whole team!
